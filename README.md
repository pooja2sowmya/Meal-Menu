# Meal-Menu
Food-Ordering-System-DSA In this project, you will create a simple online food ordering system using C++. The system should allow users to browse a menu, add items to their cart, and place orders. You will implement the backend logic using arrays for menu items, a stack for the user's cart, and a queue for processing orders.
